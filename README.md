# pizza-sales-sql-analysis
üìã Project Overview
This repository contains a SQL-based analysis of pizza sales data. The project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in writing SQL queries to solve real-world business problems, from basic data retrieval to advanced analytical calculations.

The analysis answers key business questions about sales performance, popular menu items, and customer ordering patterns.

üìä Key Insights (Examples)
The highest revenue-generating pizza is likely the The Greek Pizza (Large) due to its high price point.

The most popular time for ordering pizza is typically during the evening dinner rush (e.g., 6-7 PM).

The Classic category likely contributes the most to total sales volume, while the Chicken or Supreme category might have a higher average order value.

A small subset of pizza types (e.g., The Classic Deluxe, The Barbecue Chicken) probably drives a significant portion of the total revenue, following the Pareto principle.
